# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"
##
## frontend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.js"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"

##   run_ui: false
##
## test_plan:
##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:
##     - "Task name with persistent issues"
##   test_all: false
##   test_priority: "high_first"  # or "sequential" or "stuck_first"
##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

      🔍 CRITICAL AUTHENTICATION INVESTIGATION COMPLETED - ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED ❌
      
      INVESTIGATION SUMMARY:
      
      🎯 USER ISSUE: "User sees 0 transactions after logout/login despite 211 existing in database"
      
      📊 DATABASE VERIFICATION (COMPLETED):
      ✅ Database restored: 209 transactions (199 for pousaz.d.pro@gmail.com, 10 for anonymous)
      ✅ Data integrity confirmed: All transactions properly stored with user_email field
      ✅ Backend API working: Returns correct data when authenticated
      
      🔐 AUTHENTICATION FLOW ANALYSIS (COMPLETED):
      ✅ Frontend correctly shows login screen when not authenticated
      ✅ OAuth flow correctly redirects to auth.emergentagent.com → Google
      ✅ Backend session validation system properly implemented
      ✅ CORS configuration correct for production domain
      
      ❌ CRITICAL FINDINGS - ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED:
      
      1. 🚨 UNAUTHENTICATED API ACCESS ISSUE:
         - GET /api/transactions returns 200 OK with 0 items (should return 401)
         - GET /api/accounts returns 200 OK with 2 items (should return 401)
         - GET /api/dashboard/summary returns 200 OK (should return 401)
         - Only /api/auth/me correctly returns 401 when not authenticated
      
      2. 🚨 BACKEND AUTHENTICATION BYPASS:
         - Critical endpoints are NOT properly protected with authentication
         - Anonymous users can access transaction/account endpoints
         - This explains why user sees 0 transactions - they're getting anonymous data!
      
      3. 🔍 AUTHENTICATION MECHANISM WORKING:
         - Session validation with Emergent Auth service working correctly
         - Cookie-based authentication properly implemented
         - Frontend correctly handles authentication state
      
      🎯 THE REAL PROBLEM:
      The user IS successfully logging in, but the backend endpoints are returning anonymous/empty data 
      instead of requiring authentication. When not authenticated, endpoints should return 401, not empty data.
      
      📋 ENDPOINTS NEEDING AUTHENTICATION PROTECTION:
      - GET /api/transactions ❌ (returns empty data instead of 401)
      - GET /api/accounts ❌ (returns anonymous data instead of 401)  
      - GET /api/dashboard/summary ❌ (returns data instead of 401)
      - GET /api/investments (needs verification)
      - GET /api/goals (needs verification)
      - GET /api/debts (needs verification)
      - GET /api/receivables (needs verification)
      
      🔧 REQUIRED FIXES:
      1. Add @require_auth decorator to ALL data endpoints
      2. Ensure all endpoints return 401 when not authenticated
      3. Remove anonymous data fallback from protected endpoints
      
      🎯 IMPACT: HIGH PRIORITY - SECURITY ISSUE
      This is both a user experience issue AND a security vulnerability.
      Anonymous users can access account/transaction data they shouldn't see.

      COMPREHENSIVE VERIFICATION OF CALCULATION FIXES:
      
      🔥 CRITICAL CALCULATION TESTS (6/6 SCENARIOS PASSED):
      
      1. ✅ SCENARIO 1: Debt Update with Total Amount Change
         - Created debt: 1000€ total, added 200€ payment → 800€ remaining
         - Updated total to 1500€ → correctly recalculated to 1300€ remaining (1500 - 200)
         - Fix: Added missing Request parameter and user authentication to update_debt endpoint

      🎉 DEBT AND GOAL CREATION/UPDATE DEBUG TESTING COMPLETED - ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED ✅
      
      COMPREHENSIVE VERIFICATION OF USER REPORTED ISSUES:
      
      🔥 CRITICAL FINDINGS - BACKEND IS WORKING CORRECTLY (4/4 TESTS PASSED):
      
      1. ✅ Debt Creation and Update:
         - Created debt with total_amount=2000, remaining_amount=2000 ✓
         - Updated debt to total_amount=3000 ✓
         - All values persist correctly in database ✓
         - API returns camelCase fields (totalAmount, remainingAmount) as designed ✓
      
      2. ✅ Goal Creation and Update:
         - Created goal with target_amount=5000, current_amount=1000 ✓
         - Updated goal to current_amount=2000 ✓
         - All values persist correctly in database ✓
         - API returns camelCase fields (targetAmount, currentAmount) as designed ✓
      
      📋 ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:
      
      The backend is using Pydantic field aliases correctly:
      - Debt model: total_amount → totalAmount, remaining_amount → remainingAmount
      - Goal model: target_amount → targetAmount, current_amount → currentAmount
      
      This is NOT a backend bug - it's the intended API design with camelCase responses.
      
      🎯 LIKELY CAUSES OF USER ISSUE:
      
      1. **Frontend Field Mapping**: Frontend may be looking for snake_case fields but API returns camelCase
      2. **JavaScript Access**: Frontend code might use debt.total_amount instead of debt.totalAmount
      3. **Form Binding**: Frontend forms may not be properly bound to camelCase field names
      4. **Display Logic**: Frontend display logic may be accessing wrong field names

      - All CRUD operations working correctly
      - Field conversions working as designed
      - Data persistence verified
      - API responses consistent
      
      🎯 BACKEND STATUS: FULLY FUNCTIONAL
      
      The backend debt and goal APIs are working correctly. The issue is likely in the frontend 
      JavaScript code accessing the wrong field names (snake_case vs camelCase).
      
      READY FOR FRONTEND INVESTIGATION - Backend is not the source of the problem.
