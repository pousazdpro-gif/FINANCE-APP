The AI engineer migrated the FinanceApp to a React/FastAPI/MongoDB stack, implementing core financial management features. Initial work focused on fixing  from / mismatches, integrating OCR (Tesseract.js), PDF export, and a dynamic investment module. Recurring issues included data persistence after re-authentication, non-functional investment projection graphs, transaction import problems, and  errors during transaction creation. The engineer debugged Google authentication flows (CORS, session handling), resolved transaction duplication, fixed display errors for categories and dashboard elements, and enhanced the investment projection and OCR components per user feedback. Recent efforts addressed currency display, simplified forms, and corrected receivable calculations. The immediate focus is on enabling transaction linking to debts and receivables.

<product_requirements>
The FinanceApp is a personal financial management PWA. The user required a robust app for managing finances, investments, goals, debts, and claims, with multi-currency support and advanced tools. Implemented features include daily financial management (accounts, multi-currency transactions, categories), investment tracking (portfolio, operations, types), goals, debts, and claims with payment history, dashboards (net worth, asset distribution), and advanced tools like OCR and JSON/CSV import/export. Google authentication for secure login and data persistence is central. Critical bugs addressed involved data loading errors, graph reactivity, PDF export issues,  crashes, transaction import duplication, and  errors on creation. Key outstanding issues include transaction linking to debts/goals/receivables, debt payment persistence, mobile display, and potentially re-introducing dynamic dashboard graphs.

<code_architecture>


-   ****: Core FastAPI app.
    -   Summary: Handles all API endpoints, DB interactions, and auth.
    -   Changes: Implemented /. Fixed   and operation recalculations.  improved.  fields made flexible. Fixed  in /.  limit increased to 10000. CORS configured with  set to  (from ) for . Added debug endpoint . Added idempotency key for transaction creation. Implemented Pydantic exception handler for better error messages. Created  model for .
-   ****: Google authentication.
    -   Summary: Encapsulates Google auth logic.
    -   Changes: Investigated for data persistence issues after re-login.
-   ****: Main React component.
    -   Summary: Orchestrates UI, state, routing, component integration.
    -   Changes: Integrated new components. Implemented dynamic forms for investments. Added null-checks. Auto-category addition. Responsive sidebar. Fixed  timing to be after authentication via custom event listener. Initialized  with default  in . Passed , ,  as props to child components (, , , , , , ). Null-checks added to Dashboard. Replaced Chart.js-based dashboard components (trends, top categories, account distribution) with simple tables/lists. Implemented  state and logic to load/save user preferences and format amounts. Modified  to attempt linking to investments, and prepared for linking to other entities.
-   ****: Frontend API service.
    -   Summary: Centralizes API calls.
    -   Changes: Configured Axios with  to send cookies.
-   ** (NEW)**:
    -   Summary: Simplified investment projection, no graph. Uses editable input fields and sliders.
    -   Changes: Fixed  to properly react to state changes. Set min/max values for inputs (e.g., initial/monthly amount from 0-10000, annual return 0-500%). Added handling for zero inputs and division-by-zero protection in calculations.
-   ** (NEW)**:
    -   Summary: Advanced OCR for precise, line-by-line cell extraction and linking.
    -   Changes: Replaced  and . Integrated  for PDF support. Allows granular selection of extracted text for transaction creation.
-   ****:
    -   Summary: Detailed view/editing for receivables.
    -   Changes: Added null protection for display values.  function's invocation context might be an issue.
-   ****:
    -   Summary: Modal to link a transaction.
    -   Changes: Currently being modified to support linking to investments, debts, and receivables dynamically.
-   ****: Global CSS.
    -   Changes: Added styles for custom sliders.
-   ****:
    -   Summary: Ensures user is authenticated before rendering children.
    -   Changes: Dispatches a custom 'auth-ready' event when authentication is confirmed.
-   ****:
    -   Summary: Manages user preferences.
    -   Changes: Integrated with  to load/save user's preferred currency.

<pending_tasks>
-   **Transaction Linking**: Enable linking transactions to debts and receivables, similar to investments.
-   **Debt Payment Deletion**: Fix the inactive delete button for payments within Debt/Receivable detail modals.
-   **Dashboard Graphs**: User's original request for visual graphs in the dashboard (currently simplified to tables).
-   **Local Authentication Loop**: Investigate and fix the infinite redirect loop when using the app locally.
-   **Goals Module Enhancement**: Implement correct calculations and visual history for goals (not explicitly confirmed as fully fixed).
-   **Subcategory Saving**: Verify if subcategories created in  are persisting correctly.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the user reported that deleting existing transactions within the Cr√©ances (Receivables) tab was not functional, and requested the ability to link transactions to both debts and receivables, mirroring the functionality already present for investments. The user also reiterated a concern about mobile display.

The AI engineer has begun addressing these issues by first examining the  component, specifically the  function and its invocation, to diagnose why the delete button is inactive. Following this, the engineer identified that the  needs to be extended to support linking to multiple entity types (investments, debts, receivables). To facilitate this,  was added as a dependency, and a new  component was introduced (replacing previous OCR components) for more precise, line-by-line scanning with PDF support. The current task involves modifying the  and related frontend logic to enable comprehensive transaction linking.
