<analysis>
The AI engineer's work transitioned from an initial MVP to a feature-rich personal finance application. Initially, the focus was on migrating a vanilla JS app to a React/FastAPI/MongoDB stack, establishing core CRUD functionality and Google authentication. A significant phase involved implementing a multitude of features: enhanced financial modules (accounts, transactions, investments, goals, debts, claims), banking integration, an intelligent shopping list (renamed from Courses to Achats), global search, a detailed dashboard, an Eisenhower matrix for tasks, and a comprehensive settings panel. Persistent debugging cycles, especially related to MongoDB data schema inconsistencies ( vs ) and Pydantic validation issues, dominated the latter part of the trajectory. The engineer continuously refined API endpoints, Pydantic models, and frontend component integration based on iterative user feedback, particularly around data persistence, CRUD operations, and display errors. At the end, the engineer was actively addressing critical s impacting data loading, stemming from / mismatches in transaction data.

<product_requirements>
The user requested a comprehensive personal financial management PWA, FinanceApp, rebuilt with React, FastAPI, and MongoDB.
**Core Features:**
- **Daily Financial Management**: Multiple accounts, multi-currency transactions (income, expenses, transfers, split, recurring), categories, sub-categories, payees.

- **Intelligent Shopping Module (Achats)**: Product database, selectable lists (drag-and-drop), export, price tracking, OCR integration for direct product addition.
- **Google Authentication**: Secure user login, mandatory access, data linked to Google account.
- **Full CRUD**: Add, modify, delete all entities (transactions, investments, categories, tasks, debts, claims).
- **Data Persistence & Linkage**: All data persists and links to Google account; financial figures correctly reflect across modules.
- **Multi-Currency Support**: Link BTC, CHF, EUR, USD; automatic conversion, dashboard display in chosen currency.
- **Inter-Account Transfers**.
- **Task Management**: Eisenhower Matrix (tasks/wishlist) with drag-and-drop and an À classer column.
- **Settings Panel**: Manage categories, sub-categories, payees, view preferences (list/table).
- **Data Deletion**: Option to delete all user data.
**Critical Bugs/Fixes**: Ensure transactions save, data imports work, projection graph is reactive, and resolve  on data load.

<code_architecture>


- ****: Main FastAPI application.
    - **Summary**: Manages all API endpoints, database interactions, and authentication protection.
    - **Changes**: Significantly expanded to include new models (, , , , , ,  for debts/receivables), extended existing models (, , , , , ) for multi-currency, investment types, linked transactions, payment history, and alias handling ( for  input/output). Added new routes for categories (CRUD), payees (CRUD), inter-account transfers, currency conversion, tasks (CRUD), preferences (CRUD), debt/receivable payments (CRUD), shopping list product additions/removals, dashboard enhancements, global search, and a route to delete all user data. Critical fixes involved making models more flexible for older data and implementing helper functions for / conversions in responses.
- ****: Handles Google authentication.
    - **Summary**: Encapsulates Google authentication logic and  dependency.
    - **Changes**: No explicit changes mentioned in the trajectory, but it is a core part of the authentication flow.
- ****: Environment variables for backend.
    - **Summary**: Contains , , .
    - **Changes**: No explicit changes mentioned, but it's crucial for configuration.
- ****: Main React component.
    - **Summary**: Orchestrates UI, state, routing, and integrates all other components.
    - **Changes**: Heavily modified to integrate new views (, , , , , , ), manage new states (categories, payees, selected investment/debt/receivable for modals), updated  to fetch new entities, integrated , . Updated header with global search and category management buttons. Incorporated new modals for detailed investment, debt, and receivable views, and the transfer modal. Added logic for passing callbacks to components (e.g.,  for settings). Renamed Courses to Achats throughout. Updated rendering logic for new tabs and components.
- ****: Frontend API service.
    - **Summary**: Centralizes all API calls to the FastAPI backend.
    - **Changes**: Significantly extended with new functions for categories, payees, transfers, tasks, preferences, debt/receivable payments, and shopping list product management to reflect backend changes.
- ****: Google login button. (No explicit changes).
- ****: Login enforcement component. (No explicit changes).
- ****: **Created**. Displays and allows editing of investment details.
- ****: **Created**. Implements application-wide search.
- ****: **Created**. Manages categories and subcategories.
- ****: **Created**. Task management matrix.
    - **Changes**: Added a fix for deletion with . Updated to display 5 columns (4 quadrants + À classer).
- ****: **Created**. Handles user preferences and app settings.
    - **Changes**: Implemented logic for view preferences (list/table) with a callback to  for state updates.
- ****: **Created**. Facilitates transfers between user accounts.
- ****: **Created**. Placeholder for OCR functionality.
- ****: **Created**. Displays investment growth projections.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was engaged in debugging critical s that were preventing the application from loading investment and transaction data. The user reported these errors, indicating the backend was crashing. The AI engineer diagnosed the issue as a mismatch between the  fields coming from potentially older MongoDB data and the  fields expected by the Pydantic models in the FastAPI backend's GET response. Specifically, for transactions, the issue was identified as  (camelCase in data) versus  (snake_case in Pydantic models). The engineer had just identified this specific problem and was about to implement a fix.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Fix the  to  conversion in the backend for GET transactions to resolve the 500 Internal Server Error.
